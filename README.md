OMR sheets has been widely used across the globe for grading purpose it is a process of evaluating a human marked data from the documents such as survey, and test. This technology is acts as a guiding tool or helping tool for processing large amount of data mainly questionnaires and multiple choice test. Today we come across various entrance exams that use the OMR technology. These exams are made up of MCQs. The exam taker has to feel the bubble or the box as an appropriate answer to the question. The following proposed system helps to scan the input sheets and display the corresponding results. Using various image processing techniques such as median filtering, RGB to Gray, edge detection, compliment of the image, the answers marked for each of the questions helps to evaluate the sheet and display the total marks. This system eliminate the installation of heavy machinery, and expensive scanners in return saving time and cost. The proposed work consist of an ordinary webcam, a conveyor belt and a computer for computation purpose.
